// <November 24th, 2019, Julia Kim: Started Recommendation Algorithm>
// <November 25th, 2019, Julia Kim: Added shuffling the list of exercises such that it's not always the same exercise from the category that is recommended; for redundancy, get two least completed categories in case there was no match with the least completed category with the user answers>
// <November 28th, 2019, Julia Kim: Made minor changes in convertEquipment, got rid of images folder as requested by Spencer>
// <November 30th, 2019, Julia Kim: Made minor logic changes in getExInCat>

/*
 Notes:
 -Need to be tested with the highlighting. -> works
 -When calling my func, Arian will have to check if there's at least one exercise completed since my funcs will provide recommendation for the least completed category with the default behaviour as flexibility if there's a 4-way tie i.e. no exercises were completed or all categories have the same numbers completed.
 -I will refactor, time permitting
