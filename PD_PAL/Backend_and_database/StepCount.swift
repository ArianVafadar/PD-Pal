/*Revision History
 
 -28/10/2019: Julia Kim
    Created file, implemented CMPedometer, added "Privacy - Motion Usage Description" to Info.plist to ask for user permission
 -29/10/2019: Julia Kim
    Separated live updates and querying data history
 -30/10/2019: Julia Kim
    Tested with a real device to ensure that user permission is asked upon the first time launch of the app and that steps are counted.

    Refactoring + adding comments
