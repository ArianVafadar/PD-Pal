/*
Known Bugs
 
- 26/10/2019 : William Xue
     Call to get contents of documents directory in constructor throws an error.
- 27/10/2019 : William Xue
    File persistance of iOS simulator behviour is unknown, it is possible that the file name persists but the file is empty
    thus when we try to insert, the system crashes
