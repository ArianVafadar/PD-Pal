you need to have the following components downloaded and installed:

Firebase CLI
npm -> a javascript package manager
chart.js ->package for displaying charts on a website


first need to install firebase CLI
commands:
	firebase init				 			//initialize the firebase repository
	firebase init functions 	//initialize dynamic functions folder
	firebase serve 						//run a local version of the website on your computer
	firebase deploy 					// deploy the website in the /public directory on firebase


Before installing chart.js ...
	brew update
	brew install node
